 CREATE AN ALGORITHM THAT READS A SENTENCE,
 WHICH ENDS WITH A POINT CHARACTER BY CHARACTER , AND TO DETERMINE:

Step 1 - create a container for the sentence . We could use prompt to ask a user for a sentence.

Step 2 - To determine the length of the sentence: we can create a variable to store the length of the sentence and use the .length method to get the length.

Step 3 / final step- Determine the number of words assuming they are seperated by a space:
        first thing - split each word after any seen space into an array
        second thing - create a variable that will store the number of words found
        third thing - loop through the array of words and as we are looping through it increment the variable that stores the counters
        final - at the end of the loop the count would have stored the amount of words in the array
